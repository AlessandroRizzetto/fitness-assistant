# Multimodal Fitness Assistant
Project for the Advanced HCI course (2022-2023).

The aim of the project is to design and develop some features of a multimodal system for performance enhancement and injury prevention in sport.
In this case, a gymnastics training assistant is proposed, which is based on three modalities: gestures, gaze and facial expressions.
